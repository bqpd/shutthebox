# Shut the Box Dice Game Simulator

This python code simulates a large number of games of the '[Shut the Box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_Box)' dice game, playing them by favoring using the sum of dice over the individual dice. The code shows that worse than 1 in 3900 games is won; playing the game with any hope of winning is therefore foolish.
